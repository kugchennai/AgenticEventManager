## Features

### Dashboard

- **Bento grid layout** with responsive 3-4 column grid
- **Next Event hero card** — title, date, venue, status badge, SOP progress bar (tasks completed / total), direct link to detail
- **Stat cards** — total events (with today / upcoming / past breakdown), speakers count, volunteers count
- **My Tasks panel** — top 10 incomplete tasks assigned to the current user with inline checkbox to toggle status, priority badge, deadline, and link to parent event
- **Overdue Tasks panel** — up to 10 overdue tasks with owner avatars and red-highlighted deadlines
- **Recent Activity feed** — last 10 audit log entries with relative timestamps
- **Role-aware rendering** — volunteers see only their scoped data; "New Event" button only visible for Event Lead+

### Event Management

- **Full lifecycle** — create, edit, and delete events with status progression: `DRAFT → SCHEDULED → LIVE → COMPLETED`
- **Card grid listing** with smart date badges ("Today" with pulse-glow, "Upcoming", "Ended"), speaker / volunteer / checklist counts, and member avatar stacks
- **Filter tabs** — Upcoming / Past / All with live counts
- **5-tab detail view**:
  - **Overview** — bento grid with About section, SOP progress bar (percentage + task count), stat cards for speakers / volunteers / venue partners, and event lead info
  - **Speakers** — linked speakers with status badges; add/remove via searchable picker modal
  - **Volunteers** — linked volunteers with status + role; dual-tab picker (From Members / From Directory); convert-to-member button for admins
  - **Venue Partners** — expandable cards with contact info, capacity, cost, confirmation date, and notes; status dropdown (INQUIRY / PENDING / CONFIRMED / DECLINED / CANCELLED); venue confirmation conflict modal; auto-syncs `event.venue` field and SOP tasks when a venue partner is confirmed
  - **SOP Checklist** — grouped tasks (Pre-Event / On-Day / Post-Event) with color-coded section headers, per-section progress bars, collapse/expand all, inline editing (priority, deadline, assignee), self-assign mode for volunteers, overdue highlighting, and venue-confirmation guard on venue tasks
- **SOP template integration** — select a template at creation to auto-generate checklists with tasks, priorities, and deadlines calculated relative to the event date
- **Volunteer scoping** — `VOLUNTEER` role users only see events they're assigned to (via volunteer profile or event membership)
- **Cascade deletion** — removing an event cascades to all linked speakers, volunteers, venues, and checklists

### Speaker Directory

- **Bento grid cards** with avatar (Google photo or gradient initials), name, email, phone, topic, and action buttons
- **Event contributions widget** — linked events with color-coded status badges per event
- **Status count aggregation** — API returns confirmed / invited / declined counts per speaker
- **CRUD via modal forms** with inline validation
- **Volunteer-scoped visibility** — volunteers only see speakers from their assigned events

### Volunteer Management

- **Data table** with columns: Name, Email, Discord, Role, Events, Actions
- **Event contributions widget** with status badges
- **Promote-to-Member flow** — configurable threshold (from App Settings), validates email, creates or reactivates user with `EVENT_LEAD` role, removes volunteer record after promotion; visible only for admins when the volunteer meets the threshold
- **Member-volunteer conflict guard** — prevents adding a volunteer whose email belongs to an existing member (409 response, directs to existing member)
- **Dual-source event linking** — volunteers can be linked from the directory or from the member list (auto-creates a Volunteer record for members)
- **User-volunteer link** — volunteers linked to user accounts can sign in and self-assign tasks
- **Task assignment** — event-level volunteers can be assigned to SOP checklist tasks; `VOLUNTEER` role users can self-assign ("Take" button) on unassigned tasks

### Venue Partner Management

- **Bento grid cards** showing venue details (address, capacity, contact, email, phone)
- **Full CRUD** with modal forms, delete confirmation, and event count / status breakdown per venue
- **Event linking** with status workflow: `INQUIRY → PENDING → CONFIRMED / DECLINED / CANCELLED`
- **Cost tracking** (Decimal), confirmation dates, and notes per event link
- **Volunteer-scoped visibility** — volunteers only see venues linked to their events

### SOP Templates & Checklists

- **Template management** — create, edit, duplicate ("Copy" suffix), and delete reusable templates
- **Three-section task editor** — Pre-Event, On-Day, Post-Event tasks with title, relative days (before/after event), and priority (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL)
- **Expandable preview** — view all tasks grouped by section with priority badges and relative day labels
- **Checklist generation** — apply a template to an event to bulk-create tasks with auto-calculated deadlines
- **Task features** — status (TODO / IN_PROGRESS / BLOCKED / DONE), priority, deadline, owner, assignee, volunteer assignee, blocked reason, sort order
- **Volunteer-restricted editing** — volunteers can only toggle status (TODO ↔ DONE) and self-assign/unassign; full editing for Event Lead+
- **Auto-completion tracking** — sets `completedAt` when status → DONE, clears it when un-done

### Members & Role Management

- **Member list** with avatar, name, email, role, event contributions, joined date
- **Inline role dropdown** — change roles with optimistic UI and rollback on failure
- **Add Member modal** — invite by email with optional name and role (scoped by caller: Super Admin can assign Admin; Admin can only assign Member)
- **Remove Member flow** — confirmation dialog showing ownership count (events, speakers, volunteers, venue partners, tasks); if the member owns entities, forces selection of an admin to reassign all ownership to; soft-deletes the user
- **Soft-delete reactivation** — re-adding a previously removed member restores their account
- **Volunteer collision detection** — adding an email belonging to a volunteer directs to the "Promote to Member" flow

### Audit Trail

- **Activity feed** with user avatar, action badge (CREATE / UPDATE / DELETE with color-coding), entity type label, entity name, and timestamp
- **Change diff display** — field-level before → after changes with strikethrough and highlight styling
- **Entity type filter** — filter by Event, Speaker, Volunteer, Task, Template, Event Speaker, Event Volunteer, Member
- **Paginated API** (50 per page) with entity name backfill for legacy logs
- **Tracked entities** — Event, Speaker, Volunteer, SOPTask, SOPTemplate, EventSpeaker, EventVolunteer, User, AppSetting, VenuePartner
- **Fire-and-forget logging** with `diffChanges()` utility for field-level diff computation

### Discord Integration

- **Bot notifications** (raw fetch, no SDK dependency):
  - Task assigned notification (blue embed)
  - Deadline approaching warning — tasks due within 3 days (yellow embed, batches up to 10)
  - Overdue task alerts (red embed, batches up to 10)
  - New event created notification (green embed)
- **Admin configuration** — set bot token, guild ID, channel ID, and enable/disable reminders
- **Test endpoint** — send a test message to verify bot connectivity
- **Scheduled reminders** — Vercel Cron job runs daily at 09:00 UTC, finds approaching and overdue tasks, sends Discord notifications if reminders are enabled
- **Graceful degradation** — all notification functions silently skip if no bot token is configured

### Email Notifications (SMTP / Gmail)

11 automated email workflows powered by **Nodemailer** + **React Email** (JSX-based templates with branded layout).

> **📧 Full documentation:** [docs/email-flows.md](docs/email-flows.md)

| # | Workflow | Trigger | Recipients |
|---|---------|---------|------------|
| 1 | **Member Invitation** | Admin invites a new member | Invited email |
| 2 | **Volunteer Welcome** | Volunteer added with email | Volunteer's email |
| 3 | **Volunteer Promotion** | Volunteer promoted to Member | Volunteer's email |
| 4 | **Event Created** | Event status → SCHEDULED | Event Lead + linked members |
| 5 | **Event Reminder** | 2 days before event (cron) | Event team + confirmed speakers |
| 6 | **Task Assigned** | Task assigned / reassigned | Assigned user |
| 7 | **Task Due Soon** | Task deadline within 3 days (cron) | Assigned user |
| 8 | **Task Overdue** | Task past deadline (cron) | Assigned user (CC: Event Lead if 3+ days overdue) |
| 9 | **Speaker Invitation** | Speaker added to event | Speaker's email |
| 10 | **Venue Confirmed** | Venue status → CONFIRMED | Event Lead |
| 11 | **Weekly Digest** | Every Monday 09:00 UTC (cron) | All active members |

**Key features:**
- **Gmail App Password** — uses SMTP with Gmail's app-specific passwords (no OAuth complexity)
- **Branded HTML templates** — JSX-based email templates with amber/gold accent, responsive design, inline CSS (via `@react-email/components`)
- **ICS calendar attachments** — event reminder emails include a downloadable `.ics` file
- **EmailLog tracking** — every email sent is logged to the database with status (`PENDING` → `SENT` / `FAILED`), recipient, subject, and template name
- **Fire-and-forget** — email sends never block API responses; failures are logged but don't affect the user-facing operation
- **Graceful degradation** — all email functions silently skip if SMTP is not configured
- **Test endpoint** — `POST /api/email/test` sends a test email to verify SMTP connectivity (Super Admin only)
- **Email log API** — `GET /api/email/log` returns paginated email logs with filtering by template and status (Admin+)
- **Cron jobs** — daily event reminders, daily task deadline/overdue checks, weekly digest

#### Gmail SMTP Setup

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification** on your Google Account: [myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. **Generate an App Password**: [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
   - Select app: "Mail"
   - Select device: "Other" → name it "Meetup Manager"
   - Copy the 16-character password
3. **Add to `.env`**:
   ```
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASS=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
   SMTP_FROM="Meetup Manager <your-email@gmail.com>"
   ```
4. **Verify**: Sign in as Super Admin → call `POST /api/email/test` to send a test email

#### Environment Variables (Email)

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SMTP_HOST` | Yes | — | SMTP server hostname (`smtp.gmail.com`) |
| `SMTP_PORT` | No | `587` | SMTP port (587 for TLS, 465 for SSL) |
| `SMTP_USER` | Yes | — | SMTP username (Gmail address) |
| `SMTP_PASS` | Yes | — | SMTP password (Gmail App Password) |
| `SMTP_FROM` | No | `SMTP_USER` | Sender display name and email (`"App Name <email>"`) |

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Google OAuth** (web) via NextAuth v5 with JWT-based sessions
- **Mobile token auth** — `POST /api/auth/token` issues access token (JWT, 7 day) + refresh token (opaque, 30 day); `POST /api/auth/refresh` rotates tokens
- **Dual auth support** — API routes accept both cookie sessions (web) and Bearer tokens (mobile) via unified `getAuthSession()` helper
- **Sign-in gates** — only the Super Admin email, existing non-deleted users, and emails matching volunteer records can sign in; volunteer emails auto-provision a `VOLUNTEER` account
- **Soft-delete enforcement** — deleted users are blocked from sign-in and JWT issuance
- **Middleware protection** — all routes except `/`, `/unauthorized`, `/api`, and static assets require authentication

### App Settings

- **Volunteer promotion threshold** — Super Admin-only setting to configure the minimum event contributions before a volunteer can be promoted to member
- **Key-value store** — extensible `AppSetting` model for future settings
- **Audit-logged** — all setting changes are tracked
